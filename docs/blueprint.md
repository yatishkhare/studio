# **App Name**: MMT Maps Explorer

## Core Features:

- Full-Screen Map: Display a full-screen map using Google Maps SDK, styled with a muted base map and highlighted property pins.
- Interactive Tooltips: On pin tap, display an interactive bottom sheet with property details, nearby restaurants from Google Places (using an LLM tool for deciding what recommendations to show), and nearest metro stations from OpenStreetMap/GTFS.
- Filters & Chips: Add filter chips for budget, ratings, and traveler badges to live-filter pins on the map.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#164880), reflecting trustworthiness and depth, in keeping with the original request.
- Background color: Near-white (#FAFAFA), subtly tinted the hue of the primary to unify the design without causing distraction.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#F7941D), analogous to the orange in the original design, but brighter, to give a modern, energetic feel.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Employ a clean, map-first design similar to Airbnb, focusing on key landmarks and property pins.
